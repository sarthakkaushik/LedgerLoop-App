# LedgerLoop Quick Note

Use this app to track household expenses together.

## How to start
1. Open the app link.
2. If you are the first user, use **Register**.
3. If admin shared an invite code, use **Join**.
4. If you already have an account, use **Login**.

## Main features
- **Chat Log**: Type expense messages naturally (example: `Paid 500 for groceries today`).
- **Confirm Expenses**: Review draft entries, edit if needed, then click **Confirm Expenses**.
- **Dashboard**: See monthly spend, category split, and user-wise totals.
- **Household**: See who logged what and manage invite/member access.
- **Analytics Chat**: Ask spend questions in plain language.

## Household flow
- Admin creates invite code from **Household** tab.
- Family member joins once with that code, then can login normally next time.

## Tip
Always confirm drafts after logging, otherwise they stay as unconfirmed entries.
